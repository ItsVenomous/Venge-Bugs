# Venge Bug Checklist

This is a checklist of bugs existing in the game [Venge.io](https://venge.io/). The checklist will receive regular updates after every Venge.io update, given any of the bugs mentioned in [Bug Checklist](https://github.com/guywiddasnipah/Venge-Bugs/blob/main/Bug%20Checklist) are fixed within an update.
