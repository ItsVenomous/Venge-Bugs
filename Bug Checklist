════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

----- Main UI -----

🔳 After every match an advert tries to play but doesn't. This also causes the cursor to lock automatically and disappear.
🔳 Max limit of claiming ad rewards per day is 3. But the popup shows up more than 3 times.
🔳 It takes too long to equip a skin in Shop inventory (about 5-10 seconds).
🔳 Multiple dances can be selected in the Shop inventory at once.
🔳 The resolution range in menu settings is 20-100 while for in-game pause menu its 50-100.
🔳 With the new Friends and messages system added and old one removed, you cannot see if the message sender is online or offline.
🔳 The inbox system also isn't live like before. This means, to see a new message from the sender you have to close and reopen the inbox again.
🔳 If you visit Shop/Leaderboard/Account/Settings and then come back to main menu, sometimes your equipped skin doesn't get applied. 
🔳 Custom match issues, if you don't join within 10 secs of creating a match then you get the alert "Session is not available!".
🔳 Daily Rewards alert "You already claimed your daily reward!" keeps popping up after every refresh.
🔳 You can claim daily rewards even without watching its advert.
🔳 After leaving any match the character on the main UI takes up the lighting of that match (global ambient issues).

----- In-Game -----

General

🔳 URLs like /?map=MapName and /Spectate:A1B2C3 don't work anymore.
🔳 When in-game resolution is reduced the HUD and crosshair resolution also reduces with it. This makes text harder to read and crosshair very blurry.
🔳 After a match ends and you vote for the next map, in the next game there is no hp bar over the enemies when you shoot them.
🔳 Players get stuck on the instancing spawn point below the map. You cannot find them anywhere on the map terrain. (attach ss)
🔳 Lighting issues on guns in official map jsons. Even if you turn around there's no lighting on the weapon and hands. (attach clip)
🔳 Lighting issues on the whole terrain. For maps with brighter skyboxes like Mistle and Tundra, there should be some amount of shadows.
🔳 Reflectivity problems. Most of the canvas elements are now reflective. Examples- Ground, MineCart, Character, Rocks etc. (attach multiple ss shortened iili)
🔳 For games (mostly guest lobbies while not logged in), you join at about 20-30 seconds remaining. This time should be at least 2-3 minutes remaining always.
🔳 Abilities and Grenade affect own teammates in TDM mode (Mistle).
🔳 Respawning after getting killed takes a very long time (about 10 seconds).
🔳 Chat messages disappear very quickly. Was better before when it was about 10 seconds until their disappearance.
🔳 Black screen appears sometimes after matchmaking is complete.
🔳 Some of the elements in maps have become very bright due to the reflectivity bug. The spinning circle, potions, grenade etc. (https://iili.io/HSwkKVj.png)
🔳 A lot of times damage with weapons, throwables and melees goes unregistered (the enemy doesn't get damaged even when hit).

Heroes : Lilium

🔳 Lilium's dress overlaps on her thigh (add gif)
🔳 Lilium's grenade color has become very pale pink. It isn't the usual dark pink anymore. It also blows up a bit quicker than it should.
🔳 Grenade also has very low audio when someone throws it at you. Sounds loud only when it hits very near you.
🔳 Hammer/mallet is highly inaccurate. Hits about 20 degrees to the left of the crosshair. (https://iili.io/HSwU7It.gif)
🔳 Only Hammer and Shin's dash can de-rank enemies in gungame. This is unfair to Echo and Kulu.

Maps

🔳 Boxes within maps are extremely slippery and even worse in editor.
🔳 Trees don't have hitboxes on their leaves.
🔳 Directional cubic lighting bug. The light moves in a cube-like shape in the direction you face. (https://iili.io/HSXwpqP.png)
🔳 Spamming spacebar on box edges makes you climb up them. Likely related to the boxes being slippery. (https://youtu.be/RgbDznCvy6M)

----- Map Editor -----

🔳 Random circles appear after placing an object on the scene. Also don't go away after the object is removed. (https://iili.io/HSXgkmX.png)
🔳 A lot of times the editor and maps made with editor have objects with completely white texture.
🔳 Resizing an asset does not resize its colliders. (attach vid)
🔳 The collider "Invisible-Box" doesn't work anymore. 
🔳 Rotation handles for assets bug out a lot after an oject is rotated a couple times. (add clip)
🔳 Editor doesn't let you save and load a map after a certain amount of saves (about 20-30) (Console bug- Maximum call stack size exceeded)
🔳 Rotation handles also don't have z-axis unlike translation and scaling handles.
🔳 The size of some existing assets in editor is either too big or too small as compared to official map asset sizes.
🔳 The axes of rotation is physically still the same after an object is rotated. (attach clip, rotate a box at 45 and move it up and down)
