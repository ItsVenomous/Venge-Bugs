════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

----- Main UI -----

🔳 After every match an advert tries to play but doesn't. This also causes the cursor to lock automatically on the UI and disappear.🔴
🔳 Max limit of claiming ad rewards per day is 3. But the popup shows up more than 3 times.
🔳 It takes too long to equip a skin in Shop inventory (about 5-10 seconds).🟢
🔳 Multiple dances can be selected in the Shop inventory at once.
🔳 The resolution range in menu settings is 20-100 while for in-game pause menu its 50-100.🟢
🔳 With the new Friends and messages system added and old one removed, you cannot see if the message sender is online or offline.
🔳 The inbox system also isn't live like before. This means, to see a new message from the sender you have to close and reopen the inbox again.
🔳 If you visit Shop/Leaderboard/Account/Settings and then come back to main menu, sometimes your equipped skin doesn't get applied.🟢
🔳 Custom match issues, if you don't join within 10 secs of creating a match then you get the alert "Session is not available!".🔴
🔳 Daily Rewards alert "You already claimed your daily reward!" keeps popping up after every refresh.
🔳 You can claim daily rewards even without watching its advert.🔴
🔳 After leaving any match the character on the main UI takes up the lighting of that match (global ambient issues).
🔳 A lot of irrelevant alerts after every refresh, "Please log in", "You've already claimed your reward", even though nothing is clicked.
🔳 "An error occurred" alert even after completing a quest.🔴
🔳 LMG can't be unlocked anymore from loadout.
🔳 In your profile settings you cannot update your password unless you also change your email.🔴
🔳 Cannot update clan info like welcome message and discord link.

----- In-Game -----

General

🔳 URLs like /?map=MapName and /Spectate:A1B2C3 don't work anymore.
🔳 When in-game resolution is reduced the HUD and crosshair resolution also reduces with it. This makes text harder to read and crosshair very blurry.🔴
🔳 After a match ends and you vote for the next map, in the next game there is no hp bar over the enemies when you shoot them.🔴
🔳 Players get stuck on the instancing spawn point below the map. You cannot find them anywhere on the map terrain. (https://iili.io/HSw4uYx.png)🔴
🔳 Lighting issues on guns in official map jsons. Even if you turn around there's no lighting on the weapon and hands. (https://youtube.com/shorts/VrFCyTAo_9Y)
🔳 Lighting issues on the whole terrain. For maps with brighter skyboxes like Mistle and Tundra, there should be some amount of shadows.
🔳 Reflectivity problems. Most of the canvas elements are now reflective. Examples- Ground, MineCart, Character, Rocks etc.
🔳 For games (mostly guest lobbies while not logged in), you join at about 20-30 seconds remaining. This time should be at least 2-3 minutes remaining always.🔴
🔳 Abilities and Grenade affect own teammates in TDM mode (Mistle).🔴
🔳 Respawning after getting killed takes a very long time (about 10 seconds).🔴
🔳 Chat messages disappear very quickly. Was better before when it was about 10 seconds until their disappearance.
🔳 Black screen appears sometimes after matchmaking is complete.🔴
🔳 Some of the elements in maps have become very bright due to the reflectivity bug. The spinning circle, potions, grenade etc. (https://iili.io/HSwkKVj.png)
🔳 A lot of times damage with weapons, throwables and melees goes unregistered (the enemy doesn't get damaged even when hit).🔴
🔳 While having sniper equipped, if you spam RMB and also switch to another weapon at the same time, the scope glitches out. (https://iili.io/HSkenne.png)
🔳 Character Rigging issues. Body of character covers the entire screen while using throwables or reloading/inspecting weapons.
🔳 Sometimes kill-feed entries get stuck on the HUD.🔴
🔳 Some character skins like Egyptian Kulu are shorter than default, giving a slight hitbox advantage.🟢
🔳 After a game is left the overall audio suddenly maxes out.🔴
🔳 Ability icons do not change for different characters on mobile. Its always Lilium's hammer for melee and grenade for throwable (https://iili.io/HSSR0Bt.png)🟢

Heroes : Lilium

🔳 Lilium's dress overlaps on her thigh (add standing gif)🟢
🔳 Lilium's grenade color has become very pale pink. It isn't the usual dark pink anymore. It also blows up a bit quicker than it should.
🔳 Grenade has very low audio when someone throws it at you. Sounds loud only when it hits very close to you.
🔳 Hammer/mallet is highly inaccurate. Hits about 20 degrees to the left of the crosshair. (https://iili.io/HSwU7It.gif)🔴
🔳 Only Hammer and Shin's dash can de-rank enemies in gungame. This is unfair to Echo and Kulu.🔴
🔳 Grenade has weird properties. It passes through the ground, sticks to it and bounces off the ground randomly.

Heroes : Shin

🔳 Shin Dash doesn't cause any damage sometimes even after intersecting with enemies. 🔴
🔳 Shin's hand positioning with some weapons like tec-9 and deagle is weird.

Heroes : Echo

🔳 Echo's grapple can take you outside the map if used such. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye6cMna48N0)🟢
🔳 Echo's axe doesn't do any damage sometimes.🔴

Heroes : Kulu

🔳 Kulu cannot be unlocked with vgs anymore and Kulu quest is bugged. Quest doesn't activate until you complete some other quest.🔴
🔳 Kulu's emission doesn't work anymore.🟢
🔳 Egyptian Kulu has a tracer that you can see through walls. (https://iili.io/HS8RzPe.png | https://youtu.be/-UxjE7C83IM)🟢
🔳 Totems can be spam-spawned after Kulu dies (bery prominent when playing on a mobile device).🔴
🔳 When anyone in the match dies, the totems deactivate.🔴
🔳 Totems can be spawned inside and attached to walls, roofs, water, jars, rocks etc. About anything that's collidable. Should be placeable only on ground.
🔳 You can use Kulu's totem to climb up walls and high grounds by spamming space bar. (https://youtu.be/s6W5YPa91xE)
🔳 No dances except default work on Kulu.🟢

Weapons

🔳 The deagle's magazine is weirdly positioned sometimes. (https://iili.io/HSvdCYJ.png)🟢
🔳 The M4 starts out with 20 bullets instead of 25 when you join a game.
🔳 Weapons start out with the same used magazine from last match if you continue to next match. It should be full-mag for every new match. (add vid clip)🔴

Maps

🔳 Many advantageous spots and glitch spots in official maps. (make collage of all)🔴
🔳 Boxes within maps are extremely slippery and even worse in editor.
🔳 Trees don't have hitboxes on their leaves.🟢
🔳 Directional cubic lighting bug. The light moves in a cube-like shape in the direction you face. (https://iili.io/HSXwpqP.png)🔴
🔳 Spamming spacebar on box edges makes you climb up them. Likely related to the boxes being slippery. (https://youtu.be/RgbDznCvy6M)
🔳 Payload in Mistle doesn't move sometimes.
🔳 Rocks close to the water in Mistle don't have hitboxes.🟢
🔳 Cannot pick teams in Mistle TDM, team selection only works for custom Mistle matches.
🔳 Water in Mistle doesn't move a lot of times.🟢
🔳 Mistle Payload hitbox is really big. You can get stuck in the snake tunnel because of it.
🔳 No grapple collisions on Temple map. There are two that only flash when you try to use grapple but they don't work.🟢
🔳 AK-47 has still not been added to gun-game mode.
🔳 There are minecart tracks on Tundra but there is no minecart. They lower performance.🟢
🔳 The gliders in SandstormBlitz are not very controllable and the Whirlwinds give it very less momentum.🟢

----- Social Hub -----

🔳 For banned or inexistent profiles the "Account is unavailable" alert doesn't show anymore. Its just a blank profile with no stats.
🔳 Unable to view a listing in "My Sales" after putting something up on market. It only shows up when it sells.🔴
✅ Wiki thumbnails are broken.
🔳 Listed item doesn't get removed from inventory for quite a while after it gets sold.
🔳 Some old event items are still unsellable. Would be great if they could be made sellable too.🟢

----- Map Editor -----

🔳 Random circles appear after placing an object on the scene. Also don't go away after the object is removed. (https://iili.io/HSXgkmX.png)
🔳 A lot of times the editor and maps made with editor have objects with completely white texture.
🔳 Resizing an asset does not resize its colliders. (attach vid)🔴
🔳 The collider "Invisible-Box" doesn't work anymore. 
🔳 Rotation handles for assets bug out a lot after an oject is rotated a couple times. (add clip)
🔳 Editor doesn't let you save and load a map after a certain amount of saves (about 20-30) (Console bug- Maximum call stack size exceeded)🔴
🔳 Rotation handles also don't have z-axis unlike translation and scaling handles.
🔳 The size of some existing assets in editor is either too big or too small as compared to official map asset sizes.🟢
🔳 The axes of rotation is physically still the same after an object is rotated. (attach clip, rotate a box at 45 and 90 and move it up and down)
🔳 If you click Test map button too many times very quickly your crosshair doesn't lock anymore until you refresh page.🔴
